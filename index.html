By the great depression the world's economy collapsed. And Japan's silk market was also crashed. Suffering of million's of people's starvation Japan glanced at Western values.

                <li>Need of resources</li>
                <li>Surprise attack and get as many ships as possible so that they can conquer southeast asia without disturbance</li>
